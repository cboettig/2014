    <h2> Abstract </h2>
    <!-- Pull Readme and parse Abstract with Nokogiri? -->
Okay, so this isn't really a research topic of mine properly speaking, but as it is something I occassionally write about in the notebook (in my <a href="/categories.html#open-science">open-science</a> category) I thought it might merit it's own landing page.  I have come to consider the open notebook an experiment in scientific communication as well as a platform for that purpose.  It has been great fun testing out different internet technologies that are not available for my more traditional publications -- from analytics and social media integration to website layout, design and performance (css, javascript, static vs dynamic hosting), to XML, RDFa and other tools of the semantic web.  

Open Science posts appear under several different tags.  <a href="/tags.html#notebook-technology">#notebook-technology</a> describes various plugins and scripts I use or have explored for generating and sharing content more effectively as I have experimented with different platform (Mediawiki, Wordpress, and now Jekyll/Github).  <a href="/tags.html#Jekyll">#Jekyll</a> covers posts specific to using the Jekyll platform of course. One concept I've been particularly interested in exploring recently is how a web-based notebook can make use of Linked Data, ontologies, and other tools of the semantic web.  These posts are collected under the <a href="/tags.html#semantics">#semantics</a> tags.  Though many of these posts are documenting my experiments for my own reference, just as other notebook entries do for my real research topics, some are written for an audience larger than one and so tagged <a href="/tags.html#blog">#blog</a>  (albeit a rather scientific or tech-geek audience, aka my twitter followers).  Some of these reflect on open science policy and literature on the merits or risks open science involves.  

These research landing pages are one example of notebook technology, where the feeds below are automatically generated by tools watching my various workflows that can then be rendered here.

    <h3> Collaborators </h3>
I am greatful for the support and interaction with so many people in the open science community; in particular the other members of the <a href="http://ropensci.org">ropensci</a> project, <a href="">Davis Open Science</a> and the <a href="http://science.okfn.org">OKFN Open Science</a> chapter, as well as the endorsement of my mentors past and present.   

<h3> Funding and Support/Affiliations </h3>
I am greatful that my funding sources and affiliations so far at (UC Davis, CSGF Fellow, and UC Santa Cruz, CSTAR postdoc) have permitted my open notebook.  While the regular practice saves me time, so far actual development has been left to the status of "hobby."
