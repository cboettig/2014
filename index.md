I am a graduate student with 
[Alan Hastings](http://two.ucdavis.edu/%7Eme "Alan Hastings") in the 
[Population Biology](http://www-eve.ucdavis.edu/eve/pbg/) Ph.D program at UC
Davis, working on regime shifts in ecology and evolution. Such shifts mark the
most dramatic events in complex systems; understanding and forecasting these 
events challenges the capacity of both our statistical methods and the data 
available. My research aims to extend
and quantify the limits of understanding through uncertainty modeling, high
performance computing and large data sets. I am funded by a DoE Computational 
Science Graduate Fellowship
([CSGF](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf)).
I keep an open [lab notebook](http://www.carlboettiger.info/lab-notebook.html),
as I describe in this 
[introduction](http://www.carlboettiger.info/2012/09/28/Welcome-to-my-lab-notebook.html).
