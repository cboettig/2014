![floatright](assets/img/wadirum.png) I'm interested in problems 

I began my PhD as a pencil+paper theorist.  A fortuitous training grant in Computational Science 



Ecology
======

* Stochastic population dynamics (populationdynamics)
* Methods for detecting early warning signals of regime shifts

Decision theory
---------------

* Conservation, management & control under uncertainty and severe nonlinearity (pdg_control)
* The constraints that matter -- adding policy costs to decision theory
* Adaptive management / reinforcement learning 


Evolution
========

Adaptive Dynamics 
----------------

* Fluctuation domains in evolution (fluctuationDomains)
* waiting-time to evolutionary branching (branchingtime)


Compartive Phylogenetics
-----------------------

* Limits to inference in phylogeny (pmc)
* Detecting evolutionary regime shifts (OUwie, wrightscape)

I enjoy exposure to fieldwork whenever I can convince colleagues to take me along.  (I can carry a shovel and have eight+ years of experience as an alpine guide).  Though my own research has no field component, I'm thankful for recent opporunities from surveying pitfall traps for tiger salamanders to helping escavate icthysaur fossils in the Nevada desert.
