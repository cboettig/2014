# A custom filter to return the date that git has for the page modification time 
# Not very robust, will break if a custom title is set.  
#
#
# Unfortunately we don't seem to have access to "page.name"  
# for the filename or page.base for the page path by the time
# we are running filters (Generators do have access to this I think,
# so we could alternatively write that data across) 
# https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/lib/jekyll/layout.rb
# Example use: 
#
# {{ post.url | git_modified }}
# 

# require 'ruby-git'
require 'chronic'
