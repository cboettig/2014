## A plugin that uses the garb gem to provide google analytics data to Jekyll
# Author: Carl Boettiger
# Licence: CC0
# Date: 2013-01-13
#
# Installation:
#   
#   Install the latest copy of the garb gem from this repo: 
#   https://github.com/Sija/garb
#   following the instructions that appear there.  Then place
#   this script in the _plugins directory and follow the 
#   configuration below.  
#
# Configuration:
#
#  Create an authentication file in your home directory (adjust the
#  YAML.load_file line below) with the following structure: 
#  
#  
#  :api_key: "AIXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
#  :username: "XXXXXXXXXXXXX"
#  :password: "XXXXXXXXXXXXX"
#  :ua: "UA-XXXXXXXX-X"
#
#  and save the file as .garb_auth.yaml.  This prevents your 
#  secret credentials from being visible in the source code of your 
#  Jekyll site.  
# 
# Usage: 
#
#  Use by invoking the liquid code: (Note: No spaces around page.url!) 
#      {% pageviews %}{{page.url}}{% endpageviews %}
#  to show the pageviews of page.url.  Update the start date below,
#  or remove to show views in the last 30 days.  Of course the analytics
#  data shown can be arbitrarily customized, see the garb gem repository
#  for details.

        ## FIXME Unclear why this does not include data on pages, e.g. vita.html, research.html, etc.  
        ### Perhaps need to search for these explicitly, but rather annoying...

            if defined?(result.pageviews)
              views = result.pageviews
