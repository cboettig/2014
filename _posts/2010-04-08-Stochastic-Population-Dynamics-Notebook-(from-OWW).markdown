Research

-   Reviewed timescales manuscript.
-   Revisiting




Meeting
-------

-   Basically I want to apply central limit theorem for stationary
    processes (accounts for covariances), assuming mean zero

$$\frac{X_1 + ... + X_n}{\sqrt{\sigma^2 n}} \propto N(0,1)$$

where

$$\sigma^2 = E X^2 + 2 \sum_{i,j}^n Cov(X_i, X_j)$$

-   Discussion of
    [Freidlinâ€“Wentzell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freidlin%E2%80%93Wentzell_theorem "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freidlin%E2%80%93Wentzell_theorem")
    theory in connection to Arrhenius law and the well-defined
    stochastic tipping point which occurs before the branch point.
-   Kurtz results don't really help in the case of ergodicity, can make
    statements about the (even non-stationary) ensemble limit.

\

### Goals / To Do

-   send Alan manuscript outline on ergodicity problem
-   Finish both reviews
-   variance of variance calculation!
