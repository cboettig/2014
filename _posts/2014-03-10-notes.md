- RNeXML merge travis integration with support for rrdf. See [pull #57](https://github.com/ropensci/RNeXML/pull/57)
- Reply to Perry re nonparametric approaches

- 10am Andrew Skype meeting re: his manuscript

- rOpenSci discussion re: other services, formats. 

- Reading [Caldwell et al, Geophysical Letters](http://doi.org/10.1002/2014GL059205 "Statistical Significance of Climate Sensitivity Predictors Obtained by Data Mining"). Good example of naiive data mining leading to spurious correlations from non-independent models.  (/ht [@FreshwaterEcology](http://twitter.com/FreshwaterEcology)


- Looking over NSF's Data Infrastructure Building Blocks, [DIBB](http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504776&WT.mc_id=USNSF_39&WT.mc_ev=click) call and previously funded work.  


- Remote control for Ubuntu via android?  Considering: 
  - xbmc with xbmc-remote: Looks promising if a bit heavy; connection unsuccessful.  
  - WiFi Mouse successful connection via autoconnect and thethered wireless, works pretty smothly with limited setup.  Does need root running `mouseserver`, installed from an open source `.deb` file.  


- 2pm rOpenSci conference call




Bayesian Early Warning
----------------------

Continuing calculation from [2013/12/10](http://carlboettiger.info/2013/12/10/notes.html), which integrates out $\theta$.  Next steps: 

- Integrate out $\sigma$
- Grid-search $\alpha$
- Implement numerically

- Implement approach for time-heterogeneous case.
