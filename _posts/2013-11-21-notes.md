Coercion, method, or function?  

Coercion and method wrap the function?  


Introduce a method only when we have multiple signatures for the function?





Character matrix formats:

- Use a matrix or data-frame?  

Users will typically read in these data from an Excel/csv file, which will be read in as a `data.frame` with species names in a column. Typically users will move species names into row-names, whether working with a `data.frame` or `matrix`. 

A data.frame keeps its structure when it contains a single column, a matrix in R does not.  

Do we use otu index or label?
