I now use the dynamic documentation software called knitr to write most entries that shore results and figures. The code to replicate the results is included automatically, ensuring that what I say I did and what code I actually ran to get the results are always consistent. 

I also version manage all changes to any entry using GitHub.  Other experimental features include rdfa semantics providing machine readable linked data, which facilitates text mining.

I could go on our provide some links to examples if you like. Writing from the phone at the moment so a bit brief but that's probably for the best. Just let me know.
