Applied Math Club meeting
-------------------------

(See reading material from [Tuesday](/2013/02/19/notes.html).  

- Start with stable age distribtution (indep of stock-recrutiment)
- Consider the *Entropy* of that probability distribution, as function of mortality, by max age
- Now consider the same for fecundity: the fraction/density of the population von Bertalanffy growth (fecundity)
- effective mortality rate - mortality rate in an unfished population, distributed with same entropy as the fished population, 
- Kullback-Leibler distance to measure fishing influence?


- Mutual information and the design of surveys?
- (information in catch data?)
- Bonsall: Information content of global dynamics from individual patch dynamics?

* `r library(knitcitations)`Is there information in catch data: a comment piece highlighting the debate with Pauly on the affermative and Hilborn & Branch on the negative, `r citep("10.1038/494303a",cito="discusses")` and editoral commentary `r citep("10.1038/494282a",cito="discusses")`.  

* Looking over this approximate dynamic programming (ADP) paper in MEE, `r citet("10.1111/j.2041-210X.2012.00242.x" cito="discusses")`.  Possibly promising.  I need to map out the space of ADP approaches and advantages/disadvantages a little more to get a better impression.

* [NCEAS Summer Institute](http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/news/nceas-summer-institute-2013) for data synthesis.  Intriguing.
