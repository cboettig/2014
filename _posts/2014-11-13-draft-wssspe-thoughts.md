Scratching out notes for lightning talk at WSSSPE...

(CB from ropensci, Karthik too. )



> Responses to the challenges of academic software can be divided into
roughly two categories. Give them better tools! Give them better training!

> We do software: over 50 packages for accessing data repositories,
integrating and manipulating, annotating and publishing data. We do
training: workshops, online tutorials, developing course materials. But
most importantly, we aim to build community. At rOpenSci, it's not about
us and them, it's about the community.  Through mostly informal mechanisms
-- hackathons, workshops, blogging, and Github -- we have brought people
together to write software that does what they need it to do.


> what does it look like? Engaging domain scientists.  reviewing new
contributions on Github -- from bugs and Pull Requests to completely
new packages. Hackathons, bringing people together to code away on
whatever itch they've always wanted to scratch.  Discussions on blogs
on social media, conferences, and even here at WSSSPE.  We want domain
practioners to look up and see other domain practioners learning this
process, learning to code, to write tests and rely on version control,
and to think how things can be done differently.

> Because the hardest part isn't walking the path to sustainable software.
The hardest part is knowing you want to walk it in the first place.
At the end of the day, our success isn't measured in software packages,
publications, or grant dollars; but here, in new faces (on Github, blog,
or live events) that say "I'm here! I get it!"

> Thank you,

<!--
We build tools in a language familiar to the domain scientists we expect
to use them, not just to save them time or make them more reproducible
in the future, but help them right now to do something they cannot
otherwise do.

## Give them tools! ## 

- Native language tools: 
  Very widespread use of R in our focal disciplines)
- Save users time _today_: 
  Tools that do something users already want to do and can't (query arbitrary species distributions & plot on map!, yay! automatically publish data/metadata to repository, yay!), are easier to adopt than ones that make you re-learn how to do something you already know. 
- Save them even more time in the future
  all the reproducibility & sustainability goodness baked in

## Give them training! ## 

- Workshops
- self-driven tutorials
- train-the-trainers: modular teaching


## Give them community! ##

- Hackathons
- Real people
- Social media: Github, Website & blog, Twitter
