With some hesitation at the cost of $95, I did pay the "Open Access Publishing PLUS" fee upon filing my dissertation, so it comes as something of a surprise to learn that my dissertation does not appear in the ProQuest database.  I have emailed our administrator to follow up.  Perhaps that in itself is enough reason to motivate my decisions to disseminate my work on FigShare.  In addition to the high cost I had to pay to (attempt to) make my dissertation open access through the UC system, I found the UC submission system antiquated, clumsy in comparison to the FigShare system, and so opaque that I have not yet even attempted to find where it is actually displayed. Compare to FigShare, where I immediately see not only where the document is displayed, but can share a link to it through social media with one click and see how many times it has been viewed.  

Using the Figshare API, I was then able to programmatic-ally upload my lab notebooks with two years of research entries as a kind of supplement, along with both the slides from my departmental exit seminar and link to a video of my exit talk at my annual Fellowship conference as well.  This provides a more complete package than simply submitting the PDF.  

On FigShare, I feel my dissertation is more discoverable.  It is instantly assigned a DOI and has a permanent link backed by CLOCKSS archiving, an international network of 12 geopolitically distributed libraries that will provide the content should Figshare ever go out of business.   FigShare is indexed by Google and Google Scholar, and is itself becoming a starting point for academic searches; something that will only expand further through its rapidly developing API. Figshare has a strong commitment to open access indicated by its pricing model: public data and documents can be shared with no cost.   

Figshare does a nice job of displaying my dissertation on it's own page with an interactive preview window, essential metadata, and comment box; and has shown interest in integration with hypothes.is when it is released, which could provide a better platform for comment exchange. Figshare is also clear about what copyright license covers the work, while I am not entirely clear what terms apply under the ProQuest model.  As I'm sure you know, the CC-by license is an essential tool in Open Access publishing, which cannot reach it's potential under more restrictive licenses often but forward by publishers under the same phrase, as eloquently expressed in a recent Nature editorial by Dr. Neylon (and elsewhere).  

I have often benefited from reading PhD dissertations, though I have never accessed them through ProQuest.  Google search and the author's website are usually my first stop, which integrates nicely to the Figshare model.   The link on my homepage vita is to the copy on Figshare.  

As you know, assessing reuse is difficult, and to disambiguate use enabled by Open Access to other use is more difficult still. I posted my dissertation on Figshare without making any mention of having done so to anyone.  Within the hour, one of my colleagues had tweeted it, along with the link, which then bounced around G+ and twitter a bit and soon I started getting messages from colleagues to say they had seen or downloaded it, including one of my former advisers from my undergraduate who hadn't realized I had graduated. 



Hope this helps, I'll be interested in following your work on this topic.  Feel free to quote/re-use any of this as you see fit (as they say, CC0).   I guess my response focuses on why I felt Figshare was a good platform to achieve open access objectives, rather than address so much why I would want open access in the first place.  Obviously I believe in the broad concept of open access (or not obviously, if my publication record is anything to go by -- but I am also a pragmatist guided by the advise of my mentors, co-authors and senior colleagues).  Happy to expand or clarify if necessary.
