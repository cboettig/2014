For the past two years I have made an effort to sign all my reviews (about 30, a bit more than one a month).  It isn't because I believe in radical openess or something crazy like that.  Its really just my self interest involved -- or at least mostly.  Writing a review is an incredibly time consuming, and largely thankless task.  Supposedly anonymous peer review is supposed to protect the reviewer, particularly the scenario of the less established scientist critiquing the work of the more established.  I am sure it occasionally serves that purpose.  On the other hand, that very scenario can be the *most* profitable time to sign a review.  Really, when are you more likely to get an esteemed colleague to closely read your every argument than when you're holding up their publication?  

While the possibility of a vindictive and powerful author sounds daunting, but rather inconsistent with my impression of most scientists, who are more apt to be impressed by an intelligent even if flawed critique than by simple praise.  I find it hardest to sign a review that I have found very little constructive criticism to offer.  Of course there are the occasional terrible paper
