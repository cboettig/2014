An interesting story is unfolding around `rfishbase`. Several users have contacted me about the desire to access additional data structures that are not currently exposed by the package.  I have been in contact with the FishBase team about this issue.  I gather they are overworked and underfunded, and while their replies have been positive, they have also been slow to do anything.  I have gotten in touch with related projects that are also interested, and one of the FishBase team-members from UBC has been particularly pro-active.  Another rfishbase user contacted me last week, who works full time as a software developer.  I put him in touch with the UBC team, and he is willing to volunteer the hours and expertise the FishBase development team lacks to help transform the database into a full API.  I think this is a very promising development and a nice example of a community effort.
