*Who visits the notebook? Where does that data come from?*



My data comes primarily through Google analytics, though also through comments from colleagues.  Analytics are quite rich, showing visits from around the globe; mostly from university towns.  Visits come in from searches about two thirds of the time. Rest come from links on academic blogs, forums and social media.  Most visitors spend several minutes on a page and view several pages. Some leave comments or contact me directly about an entry, and others share my links on social media like Twitter. 

I say it is difficult because these things are not perfect. Some visitors block analytics or access through RSS feeds instead. Some may view the source code vein on GitHub or the archival copy on figshare. These views aren't reported.  On the other hand, some visitorss may not find what they wanted.  The best information comes from direct interaction with readers -- almost always other academics with an interest in the research, the open science aspects or the technology itself.
