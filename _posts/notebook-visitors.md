*Who visits the notebook? Where does that data come from?*


My data comes primarily through Google analytics, though also through comments from colleagues.  Analytics are quite rich, showing visits from around the globe; mostly from university towns.  Visits come in from searches about two thirds of the time. Rest come from links on academic blogs, forums and social media.  Most visitors spend several minutes on a page and view several pages. Some leave comments or contact me directly about an entry, and others share my links on social media like Twitter. 

I say it is difficult because these things are not perfect. Some visitors block analytics or access through RSS feeds instead. Some may view the source code vein on GitHub or the archival copy on figshare. These views aren't reported.  On the other hand, some visitorss may not find what they wanted.  The best information comes from direct interaction with readers -- almost always other academics with an interest in the research, the open science aspects or the technology itself. 




How do users find the notebook?  
-------------------------------

* Google search
* Social media
* RSS feeds
* Other sites
* Direct link


How do users interact with the notebook?
----------------------------------------

* **Page popularity** is one of the most basic statistics to understand.  While finding meaningful baselines is a challenge for any web analytics investigation, one can at least compare relative traffic
* Visitor flow
* Comments
* Mentions and inbound links
* Outging links, citations

Who uses the notebook?
----------------------

This is a more difficult question that can be approached in several ways.  The simplest is geographic:

![Map of user visits from XXX to XXX]()

Resolving geographic data to the city level shows an unsurprising signal of college campuses, particularly evident when these do not align directly with population size at large.  Like the other questions mentioned here, direct feedback and discussions captured in social media provide a more detailed if less representative look at this question. 

Anecdotally I've found that my younger colleagues encounter the content quite often (either by search or direct feed).

Meanwhile my own mentors are less likely to see anything in the notebook (even when I include direct links in emails -- though certainly with better success than I've had linking them to content on Github). That may say more about the hands-off style of my mentors than anything else. 

One interesting aspect of this are the user-specific search results that Google now provides. Even when not signed in to identifying sources such as a GMail account, Google renders results based on geographic area and many other factors.  All of these increase the chance that colleagues (who may or may not be in my social networks recognized by Google, but may also share geographic area, search patterns, and other variables with me) may be more likely to come 
across my pages than others.  

Of course the preponderance of specific
scientific jargon inadequately represented elsewhere on the web
may also increase traffic of those with common interests. No doubt this explains the frequency of inbound searches for GTR+I+G...


Value of the notebook to readers?
--------------------------------

Most notebook entries aren't written to have intrinsic value to general readers. 

Perhaps the hardest question to answer is to measure what value, if any, these readers are finding on the pages they come across. Certainly the answer will differ by user and question. Indirect metrics such as pageviews or the time on a page provide only a rough proxy.  Direct feedback is the most definitive:

Such metrics are less well suited to aggregate questions such as "what content is most useful", though the collective picture of pageviews, comments and feedback weighs on the posts that are intended to be educational, usually on the topic of learning some technical tool or method.
