## did

- wrote [generator for ropensci redirects](https://github.com/karthikram/ropensci_web/blob/master/_plugins/github_redirects.rb)
- streamlined notebook build using generators in place of filters, see [labnotebook/#101](https://github.com/cboettig/labnotebook/issues/101) and commit [47724d3](https://github.com/cboettig/labnotebook/tree/47724d3c7131b02a75e6dc432931fc8ab97a7c9a) 


### NeXML

Get GSOC student up and running in XML parsing with examples.  

### reml

* [Semantics Integration discussion](https://github.com/ropensci/reml/issues/8)  Looks like we might handle this with a Semtools wrapper...
* [Semtools schema](https://code.ecoinformatics.org/code/semtools/trunk/dev/sms/sms-semannot.xsd) looks pretty alpha.  Wondering if this can be done in RDFa the way NeXML does?
