### How I use git with svn repositories

I don't use SVN much, but in my opinion "commits" mean something different in SVN then in Git anyway, so I'd rather not entangle the commit history.  Because merging is hard in SVN and all local changes are slave to the master central repository, commits tend to be larger, more polished things.  Commits and merges are cheap and easy in git, so I commit much more often. By having to commit twice, I am deliberate about whether I'm committing to SVN, with all the overhead that involves, or whether I'm just committing to git. 

I think my approach is much easier than [this](http://cameron.bracken.bz/git-with-r-forge)
