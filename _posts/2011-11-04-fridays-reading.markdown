## Reading


Catching up on journal table-of-contents/rss readings.


### News


Australia Researchers unhappy (unknown, 2011)


#### Climate change and Open Science


Nature debate on the Berkeley climate team's (BEST) press release in advance of publication. (unknown, 2011) Editor critiques the stunt:


> Richard Muller, the physicist in charge, even told the BBC: "That is the way I practised science for decades; it was the way everyone practised it until some magazines — particularly Science and Nature — forbade it."

This is both wrong and unhelpful. It is wrong because for years Nature has explicitly endorsed the use of preprint servers and conferences as important avenues for scientific discussion ahead of submission to this journal, or other Nature titles.


And suggests they might have posted the result on a preprint server and solicited input, rather than announcing a definitive conclusion:


> To solicit input on results before publication is not a guerrilla action against a shadowy scientific elite. Witness the posting on a preprint server last month of the paper reporting neutrinos that apparently travel faster than light: the authors made it clear that they were seeking help from the wider community to explain the findings, and the media stories (if not the headlines) mostly reflected that. To pretend otherwise can only erode public trust in science, as it is practised by all.




#### Education


A provocative letter on the lack of empirical support behind NSF's recently closed G-12 initiative (Cormas, 2011)




### Phylogenetics


Interesting study of branching models in treebase, including constant rate birth-death models and some time-dependent models (Jones, 2011)

From Bioinformatics, Spatial spread from phylogenies software (Bielejec _et. al._ 2011) and some treevis software (Pirrung _et. al._ 2011) I haven't had a chance to look at.


### Theoretical Ecology


Analysis of the global population dynamics database: uncertainty in abundance may drive the lack of signal of density dependence (Knape & de Valpine, 2012). The literature on this has been mixed, I wrote an F1000 comment on an earlier eco let paper that didn't find density dependence, in which I called for just this kind of study, so it's nice to see, if not surprising, that the conclusions here are largely a lack of signal. (Ziebarth _et. al._ 2010)


#### Critical transitions


Things I've been meaning to give a closer look into: (McClanahan _et. al._ 2011), (Franklin & Johnson, 2011), (Hirota _et. al._ 2011), (Staver _et. al._ 2011),

and still have to replicate the methodology of [cite]10.1029/2010GL044486[/cite]

These [regime shift videos](http://rs.resalliance.org/2010/12/13/resilience-and-regime-shift-videos/) are quite cute.

And [this "database"](http://www.regimeshifts.org) is a great idea, but would be more useful if it had data, not just descriptive metadata.


## Open Science Blogs


And catching up on some definite highlights from the open science blogs.



	
  * Cameron Neylon: [on building useful databases](http://cameronneylon.net/blog/building-the-perfect-data-repository-or-the-one-that-might-get-used/). insightful, practical, an so right.

	
  * Michael Nielsen gives [the best description](http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/open-access-a-short-summary/) of the state of Open Access publishing I've seen, including stories of some of the most exciting recent changes.

	
  * Heather Piwowar describes their [total-impact](http://researchremix.wordpress.com/2011/10/31/total-impact-party/) project.

	
  * Our own open science community is getting going on Jason's provocative post on getting scooped in open science. Jonathan Eisen shares his experiences and Law Professor Mario Biagioli shares a preprint on Openness, secrecy, and priority in science.
