Dear Ian, Lars, 

I am a post-doctoral researcher in ecology with a strong interest in reproducible computation. I have just finished reading your paper, "Recomputation.org: Experiences of the first year and lessons learned." Despite working in a very different field of research, both the approaches and experience you describe greatly resonate with my own experience.  

In particular, you highlight the need to make computation reproducible with minimal overhead for the researcher: that is, taking these steps only after the project is done, with minimal effort, even if the work is "kludgy" and "held together with string."  Exactly.
