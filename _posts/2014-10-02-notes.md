- Discussion with Dirk on repositories, library paths, versions.
- library paths: apt-get users the `usr/lib` path, while user-run install commands (e.g. `install.packages`) uses `usr/local/lib/`, path.  Dirk recommends that `/usr/local/lib/R/site-library` is configured to be user-writable for package installation, rather than installing into home.
- building directly from CRAN
- building dependencies: `apt-get build-dep`, needs the corresponding `deb-src` lines.
- issues and tweaks to littler see [PR #2](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/littler/pull/2)

2014-10-01:

- Discussion on [minimal images](https://github.com/ropensci/docker/issues/5)
- Discussion on [analogsea + docker](https://github.com/sckott/analogsea/issues/47)
- Blog [coverage](http://www.magesblog.com/2014/09/running-rstudio-via-docker-in-cloud.html) of Dirk's talk on our Docker work.

- [boot2docker-cli](https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker-cli)
includes linux flavors, so I might get a look at what the docker
experience feels like for those poor souls who can only live it through
full virutalization. No go on the install methods listed, but the binary
seems to work.  Unfortunately my laptop cannot run 64 bit virtualbox...

- Carsten's suggestion re docker registeries, is this something that scientific repositories might one day support? (Excerpt from my reply post):


> While I see your point that the Docker Hub might not be ideal for all
cases, I think the most important attribute of a repository should be
longevity.  Certainly Docker Hub won't be around forever, but at this
stage with 60 million in it's latest VC round it's likely to be more
long-lasting than anything that a small organization like rOpenSci
would host. It would be great to see existing scientific repositories
show an interest in archiving images in this way though, since
organizations like DataONE and Dryad already have recognition in the
scientific community and better discoverability / search / metadata
features. Building of the docker registry technology would of course
make a lot more sense than just archiving static binary docker images,
which lack both the space saving features and the ease of download /
integration that examples like the docker registry have.

> I think it would be interesting to bring that discussion to some of
the scientific data repositories and see what they say. Of course
there's the chicken & egg problem in that most researchers have never
heard of docker.  Would be curious what others think of this.
