Basically we've done some simple stuff and now would be a good time to think about tools for some heavy-lifting computational challenges standing in the way.  Michael & Jim have been a great help on this, and Jake has also helped with theoretical underpinnings.

_**Statement of problem**_

We consider the impact of uncertainty in the harvesting of fisheries which involve alternative stable state dynamics.

_**Current Findings**_



	
  * Adding uncertainty in current state means optimal escapement isn't the optimal solution (contrary to Reed model) (Sethi _et. al._ 2005)

	
  * We are considering uncertainty/variability entering at three levels: population dynamics (next yr's stock, Reed case), stock assessment (this yr's stock), and implementation of quotas, in the context of alternative stable states.

	
  * When the parameterization of these uncertainties is correctly known, the optimal solution surprisingly doesn't face many more sudden crashes than the unharvested dynamics.  (Casino "paradox" -- income generated by a casino is highly predictable since the rules of uncertainty are well known).

	
  * Errors in the parameterization of the uncertainty or the biological parameters can have dramatic effects in the allee threshold model


_**Questions for further study**_



	
  * Is the optimal strategy risk adverse?

	
  * Can we add parameter uncertainty / Bayesian learning about parameters?

	
  * In particular, can we implement the case in which stock is not assessed directly but estimated from harvest and knowledge of harvest effort, under parameters we learn about?


_**Technical capacity and challenges**_



	
  * We've developed an[ R package](https://github.com/cboettig/pdg_control) for stochastic dynamic programming that allows a user to quickly experiment with different levels & types of uncertainty on different biological and economic models from a library of options and create visualizations of the solutions over an ensemble of realizations.

	
  * Curse of dimensionality is a major challenge to go beyond the 1D training problem into the 3D parrotfish model or the learning model.  We investigated Heuristic Sampling [cite]10.1111/j.2041-210X.2010.00069.x[/cite] as a possible solution but this far this seems to scale rather poorly with the  size of the control space.
