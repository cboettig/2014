Today I officially start my NSF mathematical biology post-doc with mentors Marc Mangel and Steve Munch:  _Management for an uncertain world: robust decision theory in face of regime shifts_.  My full proposal can be found [on figshare](http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.652970).  Over the next two years, this research will focus primarily in pursing three questions: 

1. **Can early warning signals be incorporated into decision-theoretic approaches to decrease the chance of an undesirable critical transition?**  
2. **Can the use of non-parametric and machine learning approaches to ecosystem modeling and prediction decrease or increase the chance of an undesirable transition?**
3. **What learning strategies can be employed to reduce uncertainty without increasing the chance of accidentally crossing a tipping point?**


The project brings me into rather new ground into at least two new methodologies (Optimal control, specifically through stochastic dynamic programming -- something I have been recently introduced to by economists in a NIMBIOS working group)  and a new ecological system (fisheries dynamics). I had to smile on seeing that some of my reviewers fretted that the project sounded too similar to my thesis work.  While potentially understandable from a comparison of my thesis title and my NSF proposal title, I had feared the actual content had more the opposite problem.[^1]  


### The notebook and Broader Impacts

I reference the open lab notebook in my proposal in seeking to address three of the five (now eight) suggested areas for broader impact: education, dissemination and infrastructure.

I am very glad NSF gives the attention it does to the concept of broader impacts, and believe the 2013 changes to the evaluation of this section are an important improvement. In particular, using the same criteria as the merit review emphasizes that the effectiveness of the impact is assessed, and that the applicant is well-qualified for the task.  NSF provides a broad range of potential activities (and has eliminated the examples written in the [2007 guidelines](http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2007/nsf07046/nsf07046.jsp) as appearing 'too prescriptive').  For these reasons I chose not to focus on broadening participation of under-represented groups in this proposal.  Though I have volunteered much of my adult life with non-profit organizations working with underserved youth in my community, it serves nothing to shoehorn those activites into my proposal.  Meanwhile the proposal more naturally addresses several other areas which I am interesting in exploring further.

### Reflections on Data Management 

I posted a draft of my [data management plan](http://carlboettiger.info/2012/10/09/data-management-plan.html) previously.  Having recently become familiar with the Ecological Metadata Standard I will probably ammend the plan to reflect this.  No comments regarding the plan appear in the written reviews.  After all, NSF does not provide explicit review criteria of the data management plan 

> "The Data Management Plan will be reviewed as an integral part of the proposal, coming under Intellectual Merit or Broader Impacts or both, as appropriate for the scientific community of relevance." [NSF GPG](http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2j)

Since the [five merit review criteria](http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_3.jsp#IIIA2) (now applied to both sections) make no reference to the data management plan explicitly, this does not seem to encourage close review at this stage.  From the [biology directorate's guidelines](http://www.nsf.gov/bio/pubs/BIODMP061511.pdf) this may get closer attention in post-award management.  

### From the reviews

#### Comments on notebook

> The PI operates a blog (open notebook) that already receives attention and is an interesting way to promote engagement and learning across a broad community of scientific peers and perhaps the public. 

> the notebook/blog could be developed into an online asynchronous classroom to mentor others in applying the results. 

> The blog is a good idea for dissemination of results.

#### Weaknesses

1. One reviewer expresses a desire for a case-study application
2. One suggests more on broader public and under-served groups
3. One feels the proposal has "some similarities to the dissertation"

[^1]: After moving from an undergraduate in physics, I did my best to stitch my graduate work for an evolution and ecology PhD under a unifying theme in my dissertation, but it could hardly have been more across the map.  My dissertation had three papers: one in Adaptive Dynamics, one in Comparative Phylogenetics, and one in warning signals of ecological shifts -- there was no overlap in authors and essentially no overlap in the topic or reference lists (okay, Cox 1968, in the latter two).  I didn't even attempt to weave in my two ecoinformatics papers.  My undergraduate was similiarly varied.  I spent summer 2004 in an astrophysics lab (lambda CDM models with Neta Bahcall), 2005 sequencing extremeophilic microbes in a geomicrobiology lab (with TC Onstott), 2006 doing computational methods for boundary value problems during a plasma physics fellowship (with Hersh Rabitz).  Though a physics major I wrote my first JP on population dynamics under clonal interference (David Huse), my second on adaptive dynamics (with Joshua Weitz), and my thesis on forest canopy models (with Stephen Pacala).  It's all a logical path of closely connected ideas in my mind of course, but I usually assume others don't see those threads...
