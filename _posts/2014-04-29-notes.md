Labnotebook
-----------

- Configure Github CDN
- Hmm, [jekyll-assets](https://github.com/ixti/jekyll-assets). Not sure that this is preferable from just using the makefile to compile and minify assets seperately as needed.
- Move `www.carlboettiger.info` to host from gh-pages branch of labnotebook. This self-contained system is more standard, and it is strange for other gh-pages hosting to be using the same domain/subdomain to reference content that is actually on a gh-pages branch of some totally different repository.
- Updated rakefile for this purpose, based on [evan sosenko's](http://evansosenko.com/posts/automatic-publishing-github-pages-travis-ci/).

packages
--------

- fix emergent rfigshare bug due to API change.
- Ooh: Trigger [daily automated checks](https://github.com/philou/daily-travis) with travis. Could be good for builds too.
