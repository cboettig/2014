## "Effects of Fishing on the Sensitivity of Fisheries to Climate Variability"


Truncation of age structure.

juvenation (younger population), maternal effects (first-year breeders are poor), genetic selection, ability to track environment (vs smoothing -- averaging over longer times).

Outline:


#### Empirical evidence for increased variability, model explanations





	
  * Story begins with Hsieh, et al 2006.  Long time series, increasing fluctuations. (Hsieh _et. al._ 2006)

	
  * Anderson et al no age structure model (Anderson _et. al._ 2008).  Imagine waht age structure would do.  Mortality rate as noise (funny, since it's not so variable). Assumed increase r leads to instability.

	
  * Shelton and Mangel (2011) [cite]10.1073/pnas.1100334108 [/cite].  some age structure, same dome-shaped Ricker for recruitment.  Conclude noise necessary for variability -- it's not in intrinsic oscillations (large r/chaotic).




#### Cohort resonance





	
  * Starts with (BJORNSTAD _et. al._ 2004).

	
  * Leslie matrix (i.e. linear), except with Beverton-Holt in recruitment.  Intersection of 1/LEP with stock-recruitment curve is the equilibrium.

	
  * Lou's work (Worden _et. al._ 2010) finds: Resonance increases with fishing.  Random growth rate drives resonance more strongly than survival.




#### Mechanisms governing increasing sensitivity with fishing


Drive this system with white noise, introduces variability on a low-frequency trend.  Easily mistake these long-term trends for climate change effects?

Different signals in different measurements:


#### Implications for science, management




##### Scientific conclusions





	
  * It's not Environment -> Catch.

	
  * It's Environment -> Growth & Survival -> Recruitment. Egg Production. Catch

	
  * Use not just variance, but the spectrum.




#####  Management





	
  * Current Magnuson Act calls for explicit estimates in uncertainty and precaution scaling with uncertainty.

	
  * stage structured lumping loses many of the fluctuations.
