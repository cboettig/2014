* MacKenzie meeting
* paperwork to Marc
* paperwork to Karthik

## Misc

* [latex templates for UCSC AMS dept](https://github.com/cboettig/sandbox/blob/c319b983535be2e79ea8987d68ad6d21f7bc5381/tex-pandoc-tricks/ucscletter.cls) Gosh sometimes it's nice to be officially in a department that understands tex.

* [Best teacher's know student's misconceptions](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/04/understanding-student-weaknesses/) Hmm, our misconceptions are probably a bigger barrier than lack of knowledge for most scientists too...

* Ohh, [Jekyll 1.0 released](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/upgrading/), [changelog](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/v1.0.0/History.txt)

* [#openoxford's debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFJtwSXC6qA)

* Finally, you can [search within a git repositories](https://github.com/blog/1492-repository-search-on-all-repositories) (without cloning first and using grep obviously. Before one was had global search options only, albeit filtered by language, etc).
