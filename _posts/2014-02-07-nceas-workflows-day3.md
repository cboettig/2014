Discussion 
----------

of challenges and opportunities in open data and ecological workflows



Synthesis and Reporting back


Group 1.5 Plan

### Product 1: 

Paper: Visualizing global change in long term community ecology studies: the strawmen?  

- Lead: Sydney Jones


Long-term ecological research (LTER) sites have been collecting and publishing raw community ecology data for over 30 years from across the US and across a wide array of taxa.


### Product 2: 

Paper: How global trends in community diversity vary by metric

- Leads: Ben 


### Product 3: 

Data publications: Each processed dataset will be republished to the KNB along with the code required to generate that data from the original raw data, and with appropriate metadata describing both the new data table and the code itself.  

- Private datasets will be privately/securely published 
- Processed data will be appropriately linked back to the KNB
- 


Collaborative git environment share our work.  Still impenetrable to an outsider.  Why?


- Documentation of what we have done
- Modularity and interoperability
- Abstraction 

Incentives to do this better

Publishing of cleaned data and workflow

Impressed

- pair-programming
- divide-and-conquer
