Labnotebook
-----------

- Configure Github CDN
- Hmm, [jekyll-assets](https://github.com/ixti/jekyll-assets). Not sure that this is preferable from just using the makefile to compile and minify assets seperately as needed.

packages
--------

- fix emergent rfigshare bug due to API change.
- Ooh: Trigger [daily automated checks](https://github.com/philou/daily-travis) with travis. Could be good for builds too.
