Notes for talk for UC Davis on future of publishing 


Scale.  


Data.  

As soon as letters to society journals replaced anagrams as the means of documenting and sharing discoveries, scientists published all the data necessary to interpret and replicate their findings.  We replicate them today in high-school labs.  

Today's science is more complicated; all that data doesn't always fit on 6 printed pages with four color figures.  

It doesn't fit today's scientific community either.  





- Internet ended personal journal subscriptions; replaced by secret library contracts of large bundles.  Thus died the market mechanisms previously in play and lead to the consolidation of most journals under a handful of cooperations.  Cooperate bundles and the library's proclivity to be comprehensive in place of the individual subscriber's desire to be selective enabled the proliferation of journals that would not survive alone while driving out or taking over most small specialized society journals.   To distinguish among a flood of new titles researchers increasingly relied on measures like impact factor in place of historical and personal impressions.  (Anything could be published _somewhere_ and more supply of papers increased the desire for filters).  

Thus did the Internet revolutionize publishing into what it is today: a handful of major international publishing companies running a multi-billion dollar industry with the best profit margins (read least economic efficiency) on the planet. It's a recent change in a dynamic industry; perhaps 20 years old.  Another 40 years before that most journals weren't conducting peer review. 

Publication has changed little since the transition to library-based subscriptions, because this situation is economically quite stable.  

This scales really well in a write-only culture.  



(In the 1960's, Ecologist Bob Paine once told his mother his paper had 1200 reprint requests.  She replied that she had just received 200,000 reprint requests of a small piece she had written for the NY Times. )
