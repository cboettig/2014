## Friday

* some ropensci coordination 
* Adapt basic science abstract and broader impacts statement
* some writing on notebook features draft

* Writing 

## Monday

* nonparametric-bayes writing. Combining my generic position piece with the technical nonparametric-bayes writeup to get a more general-audience paper.  
* ropensci reviewing
* Note: annoying feature of knitr's `purl`: appears to generate valid "external" knitr code, but includes all options in comment headers instead of just the chunk names.  This prevents "external" inclusion from identifying these chunks currectly.  `tangle` (option in `knit`) appears not to generate any header at all.  Maybe I'm missing something.  

## Tuesday

* More writing
* Assemble material for applied math club.  Going with particle filtering `r citep("10.1073/pnas.0603181103", "discusses")`  and the `pomp` vignette
* ropensci reviewing

### Misc

* Exciting stuff happening a the #btpdf2 conference
