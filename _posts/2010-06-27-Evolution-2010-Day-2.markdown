    Alfaro. Estimating rates of phenotypic evolution and speciation from
    incomplete trees.

Fascinating talk on estimating rates when the tree is not resolved to
the species level. Approximate Bayesian Computing based approach which
simulates the tree to the species level as a pure birth process with
trait evolution by Brownian motion, estimating parameter posteriors by
ABC. Seemed to me this calculation could be done analytically, since the
Brownian rate inference depends only on the distribution of branch
lengths, which is simply exponential under the pure-birth (or constant
birth-death) model. For instance:

$$ \begin{align} L(\beta | u ) &= \frac{1}{\beta^N} \exp \left(
\frac{- Q(\vec u)}{2 \beta} \right)\\ Q(\vec u) &= \sum_i
\frac{(u_i - u_{i'})^2 }{v_{ii'} } \end{align}
$$

Well, if the branch length *v*~*i**i*'~ is exponentially distributed
with parameter Î»

$$ \begin{align} L(\beta | u) &= \int \exp\left(- \sum_i
\frac{(u_i - u_{i'})^2 }{v }/2\beta \right) \lambda e^{-\lambda
v} / \beta^N dv \\ L(\beta | u) &= \int \exp\left(-
\frac{\sum_i (u_i - u_{i'})^2 }{2\beta v} - \lambda v \right)
\lambda / \beta^N dv \\\end{align}
$$

If we simply estimated the branch length as the mean always, we'd have
$$ \beta = \sum_i \frac{(u_i - u_{i'})^2 }{2 N \lambda T }$$
