## Wednesday 

* more of the same.  


## Notebook

* stemming-based search seems to perform poorly -- i.e. cannot find phrases, weight terms in titles, etc, just most frequently occuring terms in a post.  Trying lunr, loads full text into memory but should do so only on selecting search bar? See issue [#7](https://github.com/cboettig/labnotebook/issues/7)

* Modified analytics plugin to make single call to the API see issue [#66](https://github.com/cboettig/labnotebook/issues/66)

* Tuning RDFa, primarily on vita. [#22](https://github.com/cboettig/labnotebook/issues/22) [#63](https://github.com/cboettig/labnotebook/issues/63).  Tuned FOAF referencing to common nodes.  Note that `rel` always applys to links while `property` applies to the content of the tag (e.g. anchor text, span context).  Use `rel` in span and div elements, etc, to apply to multiple links.
