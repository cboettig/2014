opendata SO launches public beta


* [Why people don't use WADL](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1312087/)
  Basically we can accomplish structure much better by having well-defined
  media types.  We can define the schema of the json or xml file we 
  return, [^1] and then the application knows what to expect and what it 
  can do with the data.  This is far more useful than just having a programmatic
  version of the API calls in the native language ("client objects").  Seems like
  REST was supposed to make such things obsolete, and to make deploying the API
  far simpler than it was in SOAP (which provides WSDL).  
* An interesting discussion on [using mediatypes for REST APIs](http://barelyenough.org/blog/2008/05/versioning-rest-web-services/),
  which might be referred to as the [HATEOAS](http://barelyenough.org/blog/2007/05/hypermedia-as-the-engine-of-application-state/) approach:

> which basically means that responses from the server will be documents that include URIs to everything you can do next

hmm, a powerful idea.

[^1]: yes, JSON has schemas too. wow.
